# Ethical Dilemma Analysis

## Misuse of Administrative Privileges

### Situation
A systems administrator accessed confidential employee data outside their assigned responsibilities. Although no external breach occurred, the access violated company policy.

### Initial Response
- Privileges revoked
- Internal investigation launched
- Access controls tightened
- Compliance training implemented

### Ethical Analysis
Administrative privileges are granted for specific operational needs. Accessing data outside those boundaries—regardless of intent—violates professional trust.

This case reinforces the principle of least privilege and accountability in systems administration. Ethical behavior in IT is not only about preventing external attacks; it also involves internal discipline.

### Personal Commitment
As an IT professional, I commit to:
- Respecting access boundaries
- Protecting sensitive data
- Exercising integrity even when oversight is minimal
