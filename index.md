## IT Professional | Automation | Cybersecurity | Ethical Leadership

Welcome to my professional and spiritual growth portfolio.

I am an Information Technology student at Ensign College with a focus on cybersecurity, automation, Linux systems, and database design. This portfolio reflects both my technical development and my commitment to ethical, Christ-centered leadership.

Throughout my academic journey, I have learned that technical excellence and spiritual integrity are not separate pursuits. They strengthen one another. My goal is to become a trusted IT professional who uses knowledge responsibly and leads with accountability, discipline, and faith.
