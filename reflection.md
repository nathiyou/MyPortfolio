# Reflective Experience

During a dedicated period of reflection, I considered how my spiritual commitments and professional goals intersect.

I realized that my IT education is not separate from my discipleship. They are intertwined strands, each strengthening the other.

What brings me peace is not achievement alone, but growth with integrity. My goal is not only technical excellence, but trustworthiness.

As I continue developing this portfolio, I am committed to becoming a professional who is competent, ethical, disciplined and spiritually grounded.
