# Spiritual Guiding Principles

## 1. Intentional Discipleship Through Agency

Doctrine and Covenants 58:27–28 teaches that we should be anxiously engaged in good causes. Growth requires initiative.

In both spiritual and technical development, I must actively choose progress. My portfolio reflects that intentional effort.

## 2. Revelation Through Focus and Reverence

3 Nephi 13:22 teaches that if our eye is single, our whole body is full of light.

Clarity of purpose strengthens both spiritual insight and technical reasoning. When I prioritize what matters most, I work with greater discipline and peace.

## 3. Ethical Stewardship and Christ-Centered Leadership

Technical knowledge brings responsibility. Administrative privileges, system access, and cybersecurity tools must be used with integrity.

My professional life and spiritual commitments are intertwined. Ethical leadership is not optional—it is foundational.
