# About Me

I am passionate about cybersecurity, automation, and systems administration. My academic training has equipped me with hands-on experience in Linux environments, scripting, database systems, and security analysis.

Beyond technical skills, I am committed to:

- Ethical stewardship of data and systems
- Continuous learning and self-improvement
- Leadership grounded in integrity
- Using my skills to serve and protect others

My education at Ensign College has strengthened both my technical foundation and my spiritual perspective. I believe true leadership in technology requires character, accountability, and trustworthiness.
